# ETHz-AML-2020-Notes
My lecture notes for Advance Machine Learning 2020 at ETH Zurich.

See the PDF: [Here](https://github.com/suniique/ETHz-AML-2020-Notes/blob/main/AML2020_Lecture_Notes.pdf). The LaTeX source code is also available in this repository.

This note was made during the 2020 Fall Semester of the course Advanced Machine Learning by Prof. Buhmann and Cotrini at ETH Z Ìˆurich. The main purpose of writing this is to familiarize me with the concepts and mathematical derivations in the course. Therefore, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of it.
