# ETHz-AML-2020-Notes
My lecture notes for Advance Machine Learning 2020 at ETH Zurich.

This note was made during the 2020 Fall Semester of the course Advanced Machine Learning by Prof. Buhmann and Cotrini at ETH Z Ìˆurich. The main purpose of writing this is to familiarize me with the concepts and mathematical derivations in the course. Therefore, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of it.


This note is mainly based on the lecture slides, tutorial materials and exercises. Some of the contents are referenced from the related books or papers. Also, some of the notes are collected from previous students, inclining [@michaelaerni](https://github.com/michaelaerni/eth-introml-lecturenotes). The reference sources are stated in the footnotes. Many thanks to them!
